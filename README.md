Our website was created for simplifying the search of different kind of events all over the world.
There are three possibilities of searching events: 
- by event name,
- by country,
- by event name and country combined.

For searching by event name you can also use our voice recognition feature: 
- say event name, wait until it's been typed and say "GO" (the searching will be triggered automatically)
- to clear your input just say "RESET INPUT" and wait till it's been cleared
- to stop recording - say "STOP RECORDING"


The result of your search would be the list of events found all over the world according to your search criteria.
Pressing the event card will show additional event info like:
- the place of the event on the google.map
- the link to buy tickets to this event
- more info in google.search 

In case your search is incorrect you will be informed about it.

Enjoy!

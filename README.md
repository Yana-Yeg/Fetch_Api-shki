Our website was created for searching different kind of events all over the world.
There are three possibilities of searching events : 
- only by event,
- only by country,
- by event and country at the same time.

For searching by event you can use our voice recognition too: 
- say needed event, wait until it would be taped and say "GO" (the searching will be done automatically)
- to clear your input - say "RESET INPUT" and wait till it would be cleared
- to stop recording - say "STOP RECORDING"


The result of your search would be the list of your needed events.
Pressing by interested card you would be showing more details of this event with possibilities like:
- to see the place of the event on the google.map
- to buy tickets for this event
- to find more info in google.search 

In case of the wrong search you would be inform about it.

Enjoy it!
